### Introduction

This is your **class repo**. This repo will have everything we do/talk about in/out of class. That means that you can find _everything and anything relevant to class on here except for the workshops themselves (and even for those, we will have links._

### Our Stretch Repo

[**Linked Here!**](https://github.com/HypeDis/2004-stretches)

Stretches will happen at the start of every class in Junior Phase!
